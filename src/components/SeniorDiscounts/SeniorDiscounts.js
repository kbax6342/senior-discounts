   <h2 className='left text-5xl font-bold my-4'>What Are Senior Discounts?</h2>
   <p className='left mulish text-2xl mb-5'>Senior discounts are a fantastic way to maintain your budget and enjoy the benefits of being an older adult. Keep in mind, there is not a legal requirement to offer discounts to seniors, so it pays to ask before you buy. If you can think of it, there just might be a discount for it!</p>

   <h2 className='left text-5xl font-bold my-4'>How Old Do You Have to Be to Receive a Senior Discount?</h2>
   <p className='left mulish text-2xl mb-5'>While 65 is the age to officially claim Medicare, many senior perks and discounts start much earlier! If you enroll in an AARP or Association of Mature American Citizens (AMAC) membership on your 50th birthday, you'll have a head start cashing in on senior discounts. For all other discounts, the minimum age requirements vary based on the company or location and can range from 50 to 65 years of age.
Unsure if you qualify for a senior discount? Don't hesitate to ask! Not all businesses advertise their discounts for older adults, so a little detective work might be in order.</p>
